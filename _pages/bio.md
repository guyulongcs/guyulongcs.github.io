I am a Research Scientist at Alibaba Group. I am working on Search Engines and Recommender Systems research in Alibaba. I'm particularly interested in Deep learning, Recommender Systems,  Information Retrieval, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist in JD.com. I joined JD through the DMT(Doctor Management Trainee) project, which selects about top 10 Ph.D from all over the world each year. I worked in the Data Science Lab, which is a research lab in the Search and Recommendation BU in JD, focuses on improving the Recommender Systems and Search Engine algorithms for e-commerce in JD. I am responsible for improving the recommendation algorithm in JD. I build the first Deep Learning based Ranking System, the first Deep Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks based Candidate Generation System, and the first Deep Reinforcement Learning based Post-ranking System for JD Recommender System.


I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, China. My PhD thesis is "Data mining and recommender systems in social networks".
