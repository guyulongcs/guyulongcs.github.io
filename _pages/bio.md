I am a Research Scientist at Bytedance, working on Recommender Systems.

Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist at Alibaba Group from May 2020 to May 2022, working on Search Engines and Recommender Systems research in Alibaba. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist in JD.com from July 2017 to May 2020. I joined JD through the DMT(Doctor Management Trainee) project, which selects about top 10 Ph.D from all over the world each year. I worked in the Data Science Lab, which is a research lab in the Search and Recommendation BU in JD, focuses on improving the Recommender Systems and Search Engine algorithms for e-commerce in JD. I am responsible for improving the recommendation algorithm in JD. I build the first Deep Learning based Ranking System, the first Deep Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks based Candidate Generation System, and the first Deep Reinforcement Learning based Post-ranking System for JD Recommender System.

I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2017, China in June 2017. My PhD thesis is "Data mining and recommender systems in social networks". I'm particularly interested in Deep learning, Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I worked as a Research Assistant Intern in Microsoft Research Asia from July 2013 to June 2015. I worked on Knowledge Base and Natural Language Processing. My advisors are Principal Researcher Dr. Zaiqing Nie (http://www.zaiqing.net/) and Professor Gerard De Melo (http://gerard.demelo.org/).
